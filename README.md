# Pong-in-Java
Java applets that apply concepts of object oriented programming to visualization of the game of pong

## Demonstration of Pong 1:

__ Pong1 was necessary because it served as the framework for what became Pong2.
__ In Pong1 I introduced an arraylist to store Ball objects which contain the physics, size, and color of every ball.
~
private ArrayList<Ball> balls;
~
  
#### I also made Pong1 an applet so that I could use the Graphics class in Java to visualize the process of every ball.
#### The visualization works by painting each indivdual ball once, and then repaints the balls after physics and randomness have been applied again at a rate of 1000 fps.

## Demonstration of Pong 2:

#### Pong2 improved upon the foundation of Pong1 by adding the following:
#### 1. 
#### 2. 
#### 3.
